#@ Cogito.org Game Engine
This is the PHP (with MySQL) script to act as the "engine" for all games that are happening around the Cogito.org Community. At completion, it should be able to record and show the score of each member, and be used to carry out games that can only normally be done through PM within the forum.

### License
The Cogito.org Game Engine is expected to be licensed under GNU General Public License v3, with the complete license file at LICENSE.md. With consensus with the developers of the application, alternative licenses can be used.
